# figure-skating-ux-mockup
Figure Skating for All is a conceptual web experience designed to celebrate creativity and self-expression in figure skating without centering competition or individual athletes. The project intentionally avoids rankings and skater tracking to reduce parasocial dynamics and toxic comparison culture. A foundational skills page explains basic skating elements—edges, turns, spins, and choreography—to make technical knowledge more accessible, especially for beginners without access to formal lessons. By reframing skills as creative tools rather than gatekeeping requirements, the design lowers barriers to entry and invites skaters of all ages and backgrounds to explore movement on their own terms. The project prioritizes desirability, accessibility, and ethical UX design.
